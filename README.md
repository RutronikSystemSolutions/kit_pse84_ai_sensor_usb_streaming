## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 AI Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_AI) (`KIT_PSE84_AI`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position

> **Note:** This hardware setup is not required for KIT_PSE84_AI.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically

4. Confirm that a green LED is flashing.

5. Connect the board to your PC through the PSOC E84 USB connector and start the GUI to stream the data.

## Legal Disclaimer

The evaluation board including the software is for testing purposes only and, because it has limited functions and limited resilience, is not suitable for permanent use under real conditions. If the evaluation board is nevertheless used under real conditions, this is done at one’s responsibility; any liability of Rutronik is insofar excluded.
